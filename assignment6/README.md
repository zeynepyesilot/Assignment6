File organization

postsApi.js : handles api requests using fetch 

postsReducer.js: manages loading, error and success states

src components: Contains post , postlist, and filterform 

app.jsx: organizes the app logic and handles derived state for filtering

Challenges faced

derived state: understanding that i shouldnt store filtered results in state, but calculate them during render was the main challenge

usereducer: switching from usestate to usereducer for async logic was complex initially
